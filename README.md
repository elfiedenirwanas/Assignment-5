# Task 1 Assignment 5
Assignment Outcomes :
  Implementation of digital image processing to enhance image quality using Pooling and CLAHE techniques
  Implementation of Transfer Learning methods for multi-classification cases using Deep Learning-based Computer Vision models, such as ResNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer 
  (ViT)

# Packages
   Scikit-image
   OpenCV
   Numpy
   Matplotlib
   Pytorch
   Sckit-image
   Torchvision

# Algorithms
  Grayscale

# The steps taken in this projects are :
  1. Question 1 :
     Import libraries
     User-defined Functions (UDFs)
     Load dataset
     Warm Up: Image processing (exploration using OpenCV)
     Change the color channel from BGR to Grayscale using cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY
     Change the color channel from Grayscale to Binary using cv2.THRESH_BINARY
     Plot the histogram from the original image
     Plot the histogram from the grayscaled image
     Max Pooling (using Scikit-image)
     Max Pooling (using PyTorch)
     Min Pooling and Average Pooling
     Save your edited image

  2. Queation 2 :
     Import libraries
     User-defined Functions (UDFs)
     Define the model class
     Set device to CUDA
     Define hyperparameters
     Define the model
     WILL BE USED LATER: Freeze some layers
     Get train and validation dataloaders
     Set loss function and model optimizer
     Start the model training
     Plot the model performance
     NEXT ROUND: Retrain the model with frozen layers
     Examine the difference in both accuracy and loss
